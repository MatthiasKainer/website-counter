## Going wild (aka Usage)

To make sure that you get to make it as ugly as possible, there are some parameters that will help you like a lot!

```html
<website-counter 
    show="visitors|sessions|page_views" 
    background="red|#000|linear-gradient(to bottom, #999 0%, #ccc 40%, #999 100%)"
    color="green|#fff"
    font="Comic Sans MS, Comic Sans|Times New Roman|your own bad idea"
    size="2rem|500px"
    >
    Add javascript or stop visiting my website!
</website-counter>
```

As you can see, there are plenty of ways to customize this! Let's take a look into the details:

### show="visitors|sessions|page_views"

show has the possible values `visitors`, `sessions`, and `page_views`. The first number gives you a rough estimate of the number of unique visitors to your website, the second tells you how many times those visitors came to your website, and page_views tell you the total number of visitors.

You can obviously add all three by, for instance like this

```html
    <h2>Visitors</h2>
    <website-counter></website-counter>
    <h2>Visits</h2>
    <website-counter show="sessions" background="red"></website-counter>
    <h2>Page Views</h2>
    <website-counter show="page_views" font="Comic Sans MS, Comic Sans"></website-counter>
```

### other arguments

`background`, `color`, `font`, and `size` are for styling this thing. They are using their respective css values. If you don't know what I'm saying, just leave them alone.
